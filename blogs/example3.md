# Why Cats Secretly Rule the World

Dogs may be called "man’s best friend," but let’s be real—cats are running the show. They just let us think we're in charge.

## Evidence That Cats Are in Control

- **They domesticated *us*** – Unlike dogs, who were bred to serve humans, cats chose to live alongside us—on their terms.
- **The Internet is full of them** – From memes to viral videos, felines dominate digital culture.
- **They train us** – Ever been woken up at 4 AM by a cat demanding food? Exactly.

## The Cat Mindset: A Lesson in Confidence

Cats walk around like they own the place because, well, they do. They demand respect and take up space unapologetically—a lesson we could all learn from.
